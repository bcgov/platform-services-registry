hey 👋,

We got your request for a namespace set. Our smart robots are working hard on this request. There is one step, the approval process, where a human is involved. They'll take the opportunity, if needed, to reach out and have an on-boarding conversation with you. If you're already a valued member of the community this will likely be a rubber stamp step.

- Request 
- Approval      <-- You are here.
