# Database

## Backup and Restore Procedures

To facilitate the backup and restore processes, we utilize a container running MongoDB tools available at [database-tools](https://github.com/egose/database-tools).

### Backup Configuration

- The Kubernetes deployment template for the backup process can be found at [mongodb-backup.yaml](../helm/main/templates/mongodb-backup.yaml). This template orchestrates the deployment of the MongoDB tools container.
- A notification mechanism has been set up to inform the designated RocketChat channel about the status of the backup operation.

### Restore Steps

To restore the database, follow these steps:

```sh
oc rsh <backup-pod-name>
mongo-unarchive --uri="mongodb://<primary-pod-name>.pltsvc-mongodb-headless/?authSource=admin" --db=pltsvc
```

Execute the provided shell commands to access the backup pod and initiate the restoration process. The mongo-unarchive command uses the specified MongoDB URI, which includes the `primary pod name` and authentication details from the admin source. The restoration is targeted for the `pltsvc` database.
