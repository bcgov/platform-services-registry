# Security Dashboard Research

## Requirements

Our primary goal is to enhance the security monitoring of applications deployed on Openshift. To achieve this, we aim to implement both Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) processes. Key requirements include:

- `SAST and DAST Implementation`: Utilize tools such as SonarQube for SAST and ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) for DAST to assess the security status of applications.
- `Support for Private Repositories`: Ensure that the security scanning processes extend support to projects hosted in private repositories.

## Proposals

## SonarQube Deployment

In order to efficiently run and collect security scan results, we propose deploying a dedicated instance of `SonarQube`. This deployment will serve as a centralized platform for managing and analyzing the security posture of the applications.

## Scheduler Runner Deployment

To facilitate the automation of security scans, we propose the deployment of a custom scheduler runner. This runner should have sufficient privileges to access both public and private repositories, as well as the Openshift cluster's Route objects.

The scheduler runner will conduct security scans on both the repository codebases and live URLs identified in Openshift Route objects. Following the completion of the scans, the runner will transmit the results to the Platform Service application.

### Platform Service Application

To enhance the overall functionality of the security dashboard, we suggest implementing the following updates to the Platform Service application:

- `UI Enhancement`: Revise the user interface to incorporate a feature allowing users to input `repository URLs`, thereby enabling Static Application Security Testing (SAST) through SonarQube.

- `Result Storage Endpoint`: Introduce a new endpoint in the application to receive and store the scanning results generated by the `scheduler runner`. This endpoint will play a crucial role in maintaining a comprehensive database of security information.

By implementing these proposals, we aim to establish a robust and automated security monitoring system that not only supports the latest security testing methodologies but also provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for managing and analyzing security scan results.
