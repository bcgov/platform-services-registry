# Use Descriptive Function Names

Using descriptive function names is a fundamental practice in writing clean, maintainable code. A well-named function communicates its purpose clearly, reducing the need for additional comments or documentation. This pattern encourages developers to write self-explanatory code that is easier to read, understand, and debug.

## Benefits

Here are some benefits of using descriptive function names:

1. `Improved Readability`: A descriptive name tells you exactly what the function does, without needing to read the entire implementation. This makes it easier for developers to scan and understand code quickly.

2. `Reduced Need for Comments`: When a function name clearly describes its behavior, there's less need to add comments explaining what it does. The name itself serves as documentation.

3. `Easier Maintenance`: Descriptive names help you identify the right function when modifying or debugging code. They make refactoring and collaboration less error-prone, as you don't need to trace every line to understand a function's role.

4. `Enhanced Code Navigation`: In larger codebases or IDEs, descriptive names make it easier to search for and locate specific functionality without digging through lines of code.

5. `Better Naming Encourages Better Design`: When you're forced to think of a good name for a function, it often reveals whether the function is doing too much. If you can't summarize its behavior in a short, clear name, it might need to be split into smaller, more focused functions.

## Examples

### Good Example (Descriptive Name)

```js
function sendWelcomeEmail(userEmail) {
  // Logic to send a welcome email to a new user
}
```

### Bad Example (Vague Name)

```js
function handleEmail(userEmail) {
  // What kind of email? Unclear without reading the implementation
}
```

In the good example, `sendWelcomeEmail` clearly indicates what the function does. In the bad example, `handleEmail` is vague—it could mean sending, receiving, validating, or logging an email.

### Another Good Example

```js
function calculateInvoiceTotal(invoiceItems) {
  // Logic to sum up item prices, apply taxes or discounts, etc.
}
```

### Another Bad Example

```js
function doStuff(items) {
  // Unclear what "stuff" means—hard to reason about
}
```

## Considerations for Long Function Names

While descriptive function names are encouraged, excessively long names can make the code harder to read and maintain. Aim for a **balance between clarity and brevity**. For example, `getUserFullName` is usually better than `getTheCompleteFullNameOfAUserFromTheDatabase`.

When in doubt, prioritize **clarity** over shortness—especially if the function is part of a shared or public API.
