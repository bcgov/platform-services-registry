# Peer Review Protocol

To enhance clarity among contributors and facilitate effective peer reviews, we adhere to a standardized peer review process as a team. This process involves the following steps:

1. Implement the entire or partial feature/fix on the designated branches.
2. Ensure that the CI pipelines pass after pushing changes to the remote branch.
3. Create a pull request to the main branch, ensuring there are no code conflicts.
4. Notify team members of the new pull request in the team channel.
5. Any available team member for peer review should acknowledge by reacting with an `eye emoji (👀)` in the channel thread.
6. The reviewer provides feedback on the pull request using the GitHub UI or initiates a discussion within the channel thread.
7. If there are comments on the pull request, the reviewer may react to the thread with a `pencil emoji (✏️)`.
8. Once the reviewer is satisfied with the pull request, or if changes have been made following the initial review, they should react to the thread with a `thumbs-up emoji (👍)`.
9. After the pull request is approved, the writer can merge the pull request and subsequently delete the branch unless there is no further changes.
