# Automated Dependency Updates

Automated dependency management plays a crucial role in keeping our project's libraries and dependencies up-to-date. This helps ensure that we benefit from the latest features, bug fixes, and security patches without manual intervention. We have two primary tools in place to facilitate this process:

- [Dependabot](https://github.com/bcgov/platform-services-registry/security/dependabot){target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}: Dependabot is a widely used automated dependency management tool that actively scans our project for outdated or vulnerable dependencies. It automatically opens pull requests with updated versions, allowing us to review and merge them with confidence.

- [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate){target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}: Renovate is another powerful tool for automating dependency updates. It actively monitors our project's dependencies and creates pull requests to update them when new versions are available. Renovate also provides advanced customization options, making it a versatile choice for dependency management.
