# Development Sandbox

The development sandbox serves as an isolated environment for local development and testing, separate from the live system. This setup grants full control over local data and mock interfaces.

## Getting Started

1. To begin with, duplicate the `.env.localdev` file and name it either `.env` or `.env.local` to set the default local environment variable in your local environment.
2. To create the sandbox environment, utilize local Docker container instances with `docker-compose`:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Services

Within the local Docker container context, `5 services` are established:

1. `Keycloak`: Facilitates user authentication for the application via Browser Login.
2. `Keycloak Provision`: Provisions the local Keycloak's realm, clients, and users.
3. `Postgres`: Serves as the database for Keycloak.
4. `MongoDB`: Serves as the database for the local application.
   - Please refer to [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass) to explore the local database.
5. `Microsoft 365 Developer Proxy`: Serves as a proxy server for Microsoft Graph APIs.
   - Please refer to https://github.com/microsoft/m365-developer-proxy for more detailed information.

- Please refer to [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) for more detailed information.

### Important Information
